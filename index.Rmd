This practical workshop will consist of a generic introduction to using the R language for data science followed by an introduction to the [Bioconductor project](https://www.bioconductor.org/), which provides packages useful for bioinformatics.

During the workshop we will be using R on a server we run. However R is free, and you can install it on your own computer. There are two things to download and install:

* [Download R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
* [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

(R is the language itself. RStudio provides a convenient environment in which to use R.)
